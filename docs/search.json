    "text": "1 Introduction\nBoth members of the group share a passion for birds and often spend hours in parks in New York, eagerly waiting for the delightful and long-awaited arrivals of various bird species. Inspired by our love for these avian creatures, we have decided to start a data science project dedicated to understanding birds, their unique traits, habitat preferences, and behavioral patterns. By exploring bird sightings and studying their characteristics across New York City, especially Manhattan, we wish to uncover patterns and insights that can enrich our bird-watching adventures. We hope that this project will not only enhance our ability to identify different bird species with confidence but also help us better understand their habits and factors impacting their “mysterious” appearances. In this way, our interactions with our feathered friends should be smoother and more informed. More specifically, we want this project to help fellow bird enthusiasts maximizing their birdwatching experiences in Manhattan by offering suggestions and recommendations across three key areas - location, time, and species-specific guidance. We identify the best locations and optimal time periods for general birdwatching in NYC and provide targeted insights for those seeking specific species. We hope that our project can indeed enrich birdwatching experiences and make it easier for enthusiasts to connect with their favorite species in NYC.",

We randomly sampled 5000 observations from all the hundreds of thousands originally collected by the eBird platform. The data_readme.pdf file has explanation of each of the 48 variables, and we are mainly using location, time, and species-specific variables for our analysis including common_name, longitude, latitude, observation_date, observation_start_time and etc. The auk package is eBird’s own package to process the data. https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/ The nycgeo package is the NYC map package I’m using to see how many species there are in each neighborhood.",

Columns like behavior_code and breeding_code also show a prominent proportions of missing data (around 50-75%), but we don’t need to worry much since they will also not be useful to us. Among all the variables that we are potentially using, only time_observation_started misses a few values, which won’t affect the overall analysis. Therefore, although some values are indeed missing from our dataset (~20%), they won’t influence our analysis since we will not be applying them to our analysis process.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Bird Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this map, it is pretty obvious that birds are clustered around the oval-shaped area in the center of Manhattan, which happens to be Central Park. Central Park provides natural habitats for a diverse variety of birds to live in. Other areas that have the many birds are Randall’s Island Park, Lower Manhattan due to the fact that these neighborhoods have more greenspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the bird distribution in each neighborhood, the pattern becomes more obvious. Birds like to live in parks. Central park, Inwood Hill Park, and the Governor’s Island have higher number of bird species, with around 200 species. On the other hand, the lighter regions are urbanzied neighborhoods like midtown Manhattan and uppereast areas where bird diversity is lower.\n\n\n3.1.2 Number of Bird Species in Parks\nWe want to go in more detail to see where in the park are birds mostly seen. After all, parks such as Central Park is so large that it would take a day to walk from the southern end to the northern edge. We plotted a horizontal bar chart indicating the types of birds sighted at specific locations, mainly parks in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the bar chart, Central park and its specific areas including the rambles and north end are the top locations for unique bird sightings. Central Park provides the most diverse habitats favorable for bird populations. Besides Central Park, Randalls Island, Inwood Hill Park, and Governors Island are also great spots for bird-watching, contributing to bird diversity and sightings. Still, among the top 15 locations, 9 locations are within Central Park. Therefore, we want to focus the rest of the Part I observation to the bird sighting patterns of Central Park.\n\n\n3.1.3 Unique Bird Species Sightings in Central Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density plot shows the spatial distribution of unique bird species observed in Central Park. The higher density of unique bird sightings are represented by orange and red hexagons. We can see that the highest density of unique bird species appear around the latitude ~40.795 and longitude ~-73.955 and latitude ~40.772 and longitude ~-73.972. They represent some specific hotspots within the park where bird diversity is most prominent: The Great Lawn, Sheep Meadow, jacqueline kennedy onassis reservoir, and North Woods. Bird enthusiasts can simply input these pairs of latitude and longitude in their maps to determine where to go and enjoy birds in Central Park.\n\n\n3.1.4 Conclusion of Bird Location\nTherefore, from the location perspective, we inspect the bird sighting patterns in the different Manhattan neighbors, various Manhattan natural locations, and specifically Central Park. We wish this analysis can help bird lovers in Manhattan find their optimal place to observe birds.",

    "text": "3.2 What types of birds are there to see?\nIn this section, we will try to provide more information regarding the specific species observations, considering that people might be interested in catching specific bird species,\n\n3.2.1 Common Birds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Sparrow and American Robin are the most frequently observed bird species, with over 200 observations each. European Starling, Rock Pigeon, and Northern Cardinal, also have a wide presence in Manhattan. Therefore, beginning birdwatchers or casual bird lovers can start with species that are abundant in Manhattan. Maybe you can snap a photo of a blue jay on your way back home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see a blue jay, go to Central Park. They clustered around Sheep Meadow and North Meadow. If you want to see a pigeon, however, they are everywhere. The bird population density map illustrates the distributions of three types of species. Central Park has the highest number of most types of birds. Other birds like rock pigeons and house sparrows are spread out throughout the city.\n\n\n3.2.2 Rare Birds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare birds like Great Horned Owl and Yellow-billed Cuckoo are only spotted in Central Park. So if you want to see some rare birds in Manhattan, try your luck at Central Park.\n\n\n3.2.3 Conclusion of Bird Species\nThe most common birds are house sparrow, american robin, european starling, rock pigeon, and so on. These types of birds are present throughout the city. Rare birds like owls and cuckoos are only seen in Central Park.",

    "section": "3.3 When to See My Birds?",
    "text": "3.3 When to See My Birds?\nBirds aren’t active all day like your local seven-eleven. Sometimes they hide in the trees and sometimes they are sleeping. A few birds have migratory patterns that make them not present during the winter. In this section we will explore what time and what month of the year to see which types of birds.\n\n3.3.1 Which Month to See The Most Birds\nWe first draw a simple line plot showing the monthly situations of the number of bird species sighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph that displays the monthly unique bird species, we can see that May has the highest diversity of unique bird species observed, indicating that it might be the peak time for birdwatching. September and October also show a notable increase in bird diversity. These months might correspond to the birds migration periods. On the other hand, July, December, and February exhibit lower diversity, possibly as a result of their more extreme weather conditions, whether it is too hot or too cold for birds. Therefore, the graph can provide relative information for bird enthusiasts to choose the appropriate time to go out doing birdwatching.\n\n\n3.3.2 Time Throughout the Day\nNext, we want to know which species are active at what time in the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe faceted bar graph shows the time the six most common birds are spotted throughout the day. They are most frequently spotted around 8 am, when you just get out of bed and ready to go to work. Gradually, they are less spotted throughout the day. When the night falls, the birds are not sighted very often. After 11 pm, no birds can be seen.\n\n\n3.3.3 Time and Season\nCombining previous results, we want to explore what time in which season should we do bird-sighting. The graph below shows that Dawn at Spring is the best time to observe birds.\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  season common_name       sightings\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Spring European Starling      1075\n2 Summer European Starling       348\n3 Fall   European Starling       262\n4 Winter European Starling       327\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring and Fall are the best seasons to see the most variety of birds. Spring shows the highest unique species sightings across all time interval, particularly during dawn (5:00-8:00) and early morning (8:00-10:00). From another perspective, across all seasons, early morning (8:00-10:00) consistently shows a higher observation of unique bird species, making it potentially the best time for birdwatching. This makes sense since most birds are more active during cooler hours right after sunrise. Besides early morning, dawn (5:00-8:00) also is quite fruitful in Spring and Fall particularly, since migratory stopvoers and feeding activities often happen during these times. However, evening (18:00-21:00) has the lowest species observations across all seasons, reflecting reduced bird activity as they settle for the night. Hence, based on this graph, we can suggest bird lovers that early morning should be the ideal time for birdwatching, and dawn would also not be a bad choice for spring and fall. For all seasons, bird lovers should definitely avoid evenings if they feel like going out to observe birds.\n\n\n3.3.4 Conclusion of Time of Bird Sighting\nTherefore, by plotting the monthly unique bird species sighting graph, the time series graph, and the seasonal graph by time interval, we hope to give bird lovers more insights into when they can observe the greatest diversity of birds, so they won’t pick the wrong time to do bird sighting and become disappointed as a result.",

    "text": "In conclusion, we hope that the project has provided an deep and thorough exploration of bird distributions, species diversity, and sighting patterns (location and time) in Manhattan. Location wise, we found that Central Park serves as the prime hotspot for birdwatching, with areas including the Great Lawn, Sheep Meadow, and North Woods having some of the highest bird diversity. Besides Central Park, Randall’s Island Park and Inwood Hill Park are also great choices to catch a bird or two. Regarding bird species, House Sparrow, American Robin, and European Starling are some of the most spotting species, if you are especially interested in rare species like Great Horned Owl and Yellow-billed Cuckoo, then Central Park should be the optimal destination. Time period wise, spring and fall were identified as the best seasons for birdwatching, and getting up early to catch your favorite birds would also be such a great idea! However, we also have to admit some limitations of our analysis. The project relies on a subset of all the eBird data, which might not capture every birding activity in Manhattan. Given an opportunity, we would like to apply the analysis methods to a larger and more comprehensive dataframe. Then, talking about some future directions we can take, we think that it would be a great idea to do some dynamic trackings which integrate real-time data to track bird movements and seasonal trends. Since we were not able to factor in weather data this time, we would love to incorporate weather data to analyze its influence on bird sightings next time. We’ve learned a lot throughout this project. Improving the ability to combine maps with time-series data effectively conveyed some key trends in bird sightings, and using interactive graphs also provides us with chances to offer the viewers more intriguing engagement opportunities, enabling them to explore specific species and seasons. Lastly, as bird enthusiasts ourselves, we can’t wait to benefit from our own analysis and interact with our favorite bird friends next time in Manhattan!",
