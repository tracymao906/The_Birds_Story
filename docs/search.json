    "text": "1 Introduction\nBoth members of the group share a passion for birds and often spend hours in parks in New York, eagerly waiting for the delightful and long-awaited arrivals of various bird species. Inspired by our love for these avian creatures, we have decided to start a data science project dedicated to understanding birds, their unique traits, habitat preferences, and behavioral patterns. By exploring bird sightings and studying their characteristics across New York State, we wish to uncover patterns and insights that can enrich our bird-watching adventures. We hope that this project will not only enhance our ability to identify different bird species with confidence but also help us better understand their habits and factors impacting their “mysterious” appearances. In this way, our interactions with our feathered friends should be smoother and more informed."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe are using a bird sightings of New York state dataset originating from eBird.org, a platform collecting bird observation data submitted by citizen scientists, birdwatchers, and researchers. Providing details about bird species, locations, and specific and detailed characteristics. The website also states clearly that the data is curated and reviewed for accuracy before being made publicly available. The dataset is in CSV format and contains 9,678 rows and 12 columns. It includes 12 key variables, including county, category, taxonomic group and subgroup, scientific name and common name, year last documented, NY listing status, federal listing status, state and global conservation ranks, and distribution status. The updates are not explicitly stated on the website, but it is likely that the dataset is updated periodically, depending on new observations and reviews. Although this dataset does not have any missing value, it has some “not available” values in some columns, so we need to preprocess to deal with that. In addition, some sightings might be outdated, so we should consider deleting them. Lastly, we have imported the dataset using read.csv() in RStudio."

This could possibly affect our anlysis of the temporal patterns of trends in birds documentation. We should consider using imputation methods to deal with “not available” data in this column."
